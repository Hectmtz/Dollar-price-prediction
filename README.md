# Dollar-price-prediction
We aim to create a prediction model using differents systems
based on artificial intelligence and machine learning. There
are different methods for building predictive models, so we
will analyze some of the methods that naturally work with the
problem we are presenting.
Doing a prediction of the dollar price using GRNN.
